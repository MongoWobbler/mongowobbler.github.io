                Christian Corsica has been animating ever since he learned he could flip through drawings
                in the corner of his elementary science notebook. His passion for animation has taken him to
                Georgia, New York, Tennessee, and Texas.
                He currently resides in Colorado making video games as a Technical Animator.<br><br>

                What is a technical animator? The answer varies because they have a wide variety of roles.
                Roles involve making a puppet to make the character move, moving the character,
                putting the character inside the game engine,
                and assigning game logic for the animations to behave correctly with player input.
                <br>Christian is fully capable of all of the above!<br><br>

                When not busy animating, rigging, scripting, modeling,
                or wreaking havoc over vfx simulations, he tends to learn something new.
                Currently improving math skills, programming languages, and working on a personal video game project.<br>
                He also enjoys kicking the soccer ball around, playing Ping-Pong, and the occasional video game.<br><br>

                Always happy to talk about Half-Life 2, God of War 4, Enter the Gungeon, Rayman Legends, Knockout City, or more!
