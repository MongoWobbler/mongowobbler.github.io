        has been upgraded to include the <i>useOrient</i> attribute. When the <i>useOrient</i> attribute is switched to <i>On</i>,
        the transform maintains its own orientation. I personally often use it to animate shrugs as seen in the GIF below.

      The only controls animated are the clavicle controls. The right side (red controls), has orient space turned off,
      and hence the arm continues with regular forward kinematics. The left side (blue controls), has orient space
      turned off, which means the arm keeps its 45-degree angle with the body.

      As of now, there is only one item left
      in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MongoWobbler/piper/projects/1">Piper's to-do list!</a> Afterward,
      I'll finally start animating and move on to what this blog is really supposed to be about, game development.
