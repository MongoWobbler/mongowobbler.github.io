    Got a basic character selection which consists of two blueprints. One that handles asynchronously loading
    skeletal meshes and idle animation to preview characters and another one that handles player input,
    loading the character blueprint with the full character suite of animations,
    and possessing the newly spawned pawn. I hope to expand the character selection blueprint to
    handle touch and drag slide input from the player to have more characters to select from.

    A note of caution from asynchronously loading objects is that blueprint "for loops" do not wait
    for the load to finish before moving on to the next iteration of the loop. To asynchronously load inside a loop,
    you have to make the loop yourself through a literal execution pin loop as seen below.
