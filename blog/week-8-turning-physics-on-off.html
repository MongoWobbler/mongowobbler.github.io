        <p>
            This week's achievements include bidirectional platforms and character movement polish.<br><br>

            Bidirectional platforms work similarly to how platforms in Super Smash Brothers work.
            On tick, if the player is above the platform, set collision to Block, else if the player is below the platform,
            set collision to Overlap. As soon as I finished writing the previous sentence,
            I thought of a more elegant solution that does not rely on tick... <br>

            New solution: Add two box overlap components to the platform that size up or down
            their width based on the static mesh collision bounds on construction.
            Then, when the player overlaps with the component above, the static mesh collision would be set to Block.
            If the player overlaps with the box component below, the collision would be set to overlap.
            I will be implementing this new solution soon.

            <br><br>

            I have polished the movement by turning physics on and off on the character.
            Now the character feels way more alive and animated!
            Physics only gets turned on when the character fails to attach or when the actor the
            character is attached to gets destroyed, so the character still moves to where the user touches
            without its movement being interfered with the physics engine.
            Speaking of physics, having this many objects simulate physics on a mobile device is fine, right?<br><br>
