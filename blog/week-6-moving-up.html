    <p>
      Got a good chunk of progress with the movement system. Unfortunately, it is still not working correctly.
      I have a feeling it is either because of UE4's physics sub-stepping messing with an object's velocity
      over time OR because of a bad trajectory prediction calculation on my part.
      Let's be honest, it is probably the latter. <br>

      Regardless, I got the character moving in a curve to a specific spot over a specific time with proper rotations,
      woo-hoo! I still need to lerp the character's rotation between the curve rotation and the rotation
      derived from the nearest normal of nearby falling objects so that the character looks attached to the falling object. <br>

      The camera also follows the player along! Once I get the movement system down,
      I can start adding game conditions such as game start, game end, and scoring.<br><br>

    <p>SLOW MO!!! Hope to be adding more slow motion features in the future</p>
