            <a href="https://github.com/MongoWobbler/piper">Piper</a> has been updated to support Python 3/Maya 2022.
            The main caveat for piper was the relative/absolute import statements that are necessary when you import
            a bunch of modules into a __init__.py. Besides that, take note of divisions where you expect an int,
            because Python 3 will return a float when dividing.
            Then there's obviously the print function that
            any <a href="https://matiascodesal.com/blog/how-to-convert-maya-python-2-code-to-python-3/">python 2 to 3 converter</a> should take care of,
            along with range/xrange and a few others.<br><br>

            Moving on to the rigging segment of the blog post, FK controls now include a local control that
            only moves the driven transform and nothing else. Similar to a butt control that moves only
            the hips and is parented under the Center of Gravity (CoG) control.
        </p>

        <p>
            Last but not least, space switching is made easy through a Graphical User Interface (GUI)! <br>
            GUI provides regular space switching on controls with space attributes, FK/IK switching on
            controls with FK/IK attributes (including proxies!), and resetting dynamic pivot transforms.
            More on dynamic pivots next week, probably. <br>
            When switching spaces, the user can turn off/on matching on the translation, rotate, and/or scale channels.
