        Honestly, not a lot of progress lately as life has kept me super busy, so I have had to put this project on the backburner. But I'll get back to you soon enough!<br>
        Got the player to move around by clicking or pressing an area on the screen. Works on the editor, have not deployed on phone yet to test.<br>
        Also got a bunch of objects spawning with physics applied, woo!<br>
        The red spheres is the location in World Space where input is detected. For now Player will only travel left to right, no up and down yet.<br.
