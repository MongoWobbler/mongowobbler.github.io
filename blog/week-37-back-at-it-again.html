    Took a bit of a break, mostly to play Back 4 Blood (cheers to Turtle Rock Studios for an amazing game!)
    and test out UE4 cinematic workflow with a soccer animation which you can catch below!

    Back to the game project this blog is mostly about; I've been mostly re-familiarizing myself with the movement model
    since it was prototyped in blueprint, moving away all animation blueprint logic for its event graph,
    fixing bugs, updating to 4.27, and building the engine from source. The good news is that updating to 4.27 or
    maybe building from source fixed an annoying bug where UE kept having to build all materials every time a single
    change to a material was made. Anyway, not a lot more to share besides suggesting
    using <code class="language-python">os.path.relpath()</code> when trying to get the <b>relative</b> path in
    python instead of <code class="language-python">lstrip()</code> or <code class="language-python">split()</code>.
